# deepfreezecloud-tools
Just some helpful tools and scripts I like to use with Faronics Deep Freeze Cloud. Mostly used for certain tasks I can't do directly within the tools.

In most cases, you'll want to set these up either as a Custom Script in Software Updater or Batch File Workstation Task in Deep Freeze. But they may also work under Remote Launch or Push & Launch as well.

I cannot guarantee that these will work with 100% reliability and you may use them at your own risk.
